The on-chain ticketing service that features three core components:
1. A non-fungible token (NFT) contract for implementing ticket logic,
2. A primary marketplace that allows users to create tickets (by deploying new instances of an NFT contract) and mint these tickets in exchange for an ERC20 token payment,
3. A secondary marketplace that allows users to create bids for tickets listed for sale by current ticket holders.
